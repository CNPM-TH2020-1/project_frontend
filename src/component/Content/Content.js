            <h2>Beginning in the mid-18th century the Spanish enclave of Valdivia started a period of agricultural expansion. The expansion was mainly directed to the south and was done mostly by pacific means, but hostilities with indigenous Huilliches did occur.[1] In 1758 Huilliche chief Huarán requested Spanish soldiers to defend his lands against his Cunco enemies.[2] The Governor of Valdivia Ambrosio Sáes de Bustamante responded to this call leading to the second Battle of Río Bueno in 1759.[3][2][4] There are differing views on the outcome of this battle; according to Diego Barros Arana it was a Spanish victory,[5] yet another view is that with battle chiefs Catrillanca and Paidil managed to halt any further Spanish advance.[4] The battle was an exception to the otherwise peaceful penetration.[3]

The expansion of Valdivia included a process of racial mixing, the purchasing of indigenous lands by people of European descent and the transformation of previous indigenous proprietors into bonded labourers.[6] In contrast, the Spanish settlement at Chiloé Archipelago had a history of conflicts with the indigenous peoples to the north. After the Valdivian colonization had reached the Bueno River, the Spanish authorities pushed to connect the city of Valdivia and the settlements at Chacao Channel with a road. This way they hoped to make it possible for Valdivia and Chiloé to offer each other mutual aid in the case of invasion by a European power.[1]

In the 1780s, when attempting to cooperate to build this road, the Governor of Valdivia Mariano Pusterla and the Intendant of Chiloé Francisco Hurtado del Pino disagreed. Hurtado del Pino preferred to confront the Huilliches militarily, while Pusterla rejected this approach.[7] After Hurtado del Pino was removed from his position and replaced by Francisco Garos, cooperation ensued.[7] In October 1788 Pusterla sent an expedition across Huilliche-ruled territory to reach Chiloé. The expedition was successful, and by February 1789 its men were back in Valdivia.[8] After this Pusterla made arrangements to improve the road to Chiloé, in particularly to widen it at places where it was no more than a narrow track through forests.[8] In a meeting the Spaniards held with local Cuncos and Huilliches, Pusterla gave assurances that the opening of the road would not imply a re-establishment of the city of Osorno.[8][A] Subsequently, safe transit along the road came to depend on the goodwill of local tribes.[8][B]

In parallel with the agricultural expansion and the drive to connect Valdivia and Chiloé Catholic missionary activity also advanced from Valdivia to the south. Spanish Jesuit Andrés Febrés supported the incorporation of Futahuillimapu into the Spanish Empire[11] and by 1767 Febrés had developed plans to establish a mission in Río Bueno.[12] This mission was however established in 1777 by Franciscans as the Jesuits had been expelled from the Americas in 1767.</h2>
